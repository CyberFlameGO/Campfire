Campfire, previously known as Wildfire, is the core for Firestarter realms! Campfire contains all of our custom features, such as a map renderer, async wild teleport command, and a ton of custom commands.



Campfire depends on [Kerosene](https://github.com/FirestarterMC/Kerosene), which is our package of essential dependencies shared across our many plugins. Feel free to have a look at the code and modify it for your own purposes as you wish! âœ¨
